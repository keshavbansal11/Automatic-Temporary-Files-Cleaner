# Automatic-Temporary-Files-Cleaner

In Order to skip the manual process of cleaning the Temporary and Prefetch Files to make the system faster, i created this "CleanTemp.BAT" script to delete the files automatically when it is called and also, i will teach you to make this script run everytime you start you system in order to make the system faster from the start-up.

If you double click the BAT file, it will run the script.

If you want to make it run by default at start-up, then follow the steps below.

1. Download the CleanTemp.BAT file from the repository.
2. Open Windows Run or WIN+R, type "shell:startup" without quotes.
3. Paste the BAT file in the folder which opened by the Run command.
4. You are done.
